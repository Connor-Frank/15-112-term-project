Project Description:
Name: Pacman++
Description: A remixed version of Pacman, the arcade classic, with some extra features added.

How to run the project:
Run `python main.py` if running in a terminal. Otherwise, run the file "main.py" in your text editor

Which libraries/modules need to be installed:
None. Stock python is fine, just make sure it was built with tkinter! Sometimes tools like pyenv won't install it if you don't have the system libraries installed, but the downloads from the Python website should work.

A list of any shortcut commands that exist:
There are none. Arrow keys and WASD can be used interchangeably, though.
